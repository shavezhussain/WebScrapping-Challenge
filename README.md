### Overview
-part_1_mars_news.ipynb </br>
This jupyter notebook file scrapes titles and preview text from Mars news articles from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html 

-part_2_mars_weater.ipynb </br>
This jupyter notebook file scrapes, cleans, visualizes and analyzes Mars weather data from a table from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. The scraped data is then analyzed to answer the following questions:</br> 
    -how many months exist on mars? </br> 
    -how many martian days worth of data are in the data set? </br> 
    -what are the coldest and warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? </br> 
    -which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?</br> 
    -how many terristrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?</br> 
 
 The created DataFrame is then exported to a CSV file saved in the 'output' folder.
